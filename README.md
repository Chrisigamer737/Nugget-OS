# Nugget OS

## Description

Nugget OS is a simple (at least for now) operating system that has been written (mostly) from scratch in assembly and c. It is based off of Fr-OS (https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS) and the tutorial that goes with it so credit to him for most of the things here! 

## Usage

### Install the assembler and virtual machine software
```bash
brew install qemu nasm
```
### Install the c cross compiler

```
brew install i386-elf-binutils
brew install i386-elf-gcc
brew install i386-elf-gdb
```

### Running
For normal operation.
```
make
```
For debug gdb shell.
```
make debug
```
## Contributing

### What am I after?
I need c devlopers mainly but other skills may be required down the track.

### How to contribute?
For now all you can do is pull requests and maybe post an issue now and then but I may create a public discord server later in development.
